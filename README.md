# Welcome to deltaDeploy!

**deltaDeploy** pushes live iterations up the deployment chain, without pausing or slowing the pace of development.

**deltaDeploy** integrates with a companyâ€™s Change Management system and workflows to deploy changes as they meet Change Management approval. It is a Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline for SQL Database, Markit EDM, and OS Flat File changes.

**deltaDeploy** works in conjunction with [deltaRefresh](https://github.com/enterprise-data-foundation/delta-refresh) and [deltaTest](https://github.com/enterprise-data-foundation/delta-test) to deliver a robust, partly open-source DevOps pipeline that facilitates Test Driven Development, automated regression testing, and Continuous Delivery across your team.

With **deltaDeploy**, you will...

* Integrate with **deltaTest** to deploy changes automatically.
* Integrate with **deltaRefresh** to refresh data across environments automatically.
* Keep your Data Management project moving forward with true Continuous Delivery!

**deltaDeploy** is NOT open-source. Contact [Continuus Technologies](https://continuus-technologies.com) for more info!
